# bamazon_storefront

<h1> Description</h1>

Bamazon is an interactive Amazon-like storefront built using the MySQL database and Node.js. It runs on the command line using both the inquirer and mysql database npm packages.

<h1> Customer Interface </h1>

The customer interface on the Bamazon store front allows the user to view the store's inventory provided through data from a MySQL table. If the customer wishes to do so they can purchase different quantities of items using the item's id depending on available inventory. If a purchase is successful the customer will be given an order total and can continue shopping with updated inventory. If there is insufficient stock the customer will be prompted and can choose to continue shopping.
